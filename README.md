# Royco V2: The Incentivize Anything Protocol
![Royco Banner](./roycobanner.png)

Royco V2 allows anyone to create a market to incentivize any action(s), on or off chain. We call these markets Incentivized Action Markets (IAMs).
In IAMs, Incentive Providers (IPs) offer incentives, like tokens or points, for Action Providers (APs) to perform actions. IPs and APs make offers/counter-offers until they agree upon an incentive amount for which the AP will complete the transaction. When they agree, the AP needs to perform the action(s) as specified by their onchain agreement in order to claim their incentives.
